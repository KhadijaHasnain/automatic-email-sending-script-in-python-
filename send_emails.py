# Compose the email
subject = "Exciting Marketing Offer!"
To format the body of the email with bold text, you can use HTML formatting within the body of the email. Here's how you can modify the `body` variable to include bold text:

```python
html = f"""\
    <html>
      <body>
        <p style="color:red;">Your main text goes here.</p>
        <p style="color:green;"><strong>Contact Us:</strong><br>Email: {email}<br>Phone: +1234567890</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    """

This HTML structure uses `<strong>` tags to make the text bold. When you send this email, it will appear with the specified formatting. Just replace the `body` variable in your code with this updated version.

# Send email to each address
for email in emails:
    mail = outlook.CreateItem(0)
    mail.To = email
    mail.Subject = subject
    mail.Body = body
    mail.Send()

print("Emails have been sent successfully!")
