To send marketing emails using Outlook, you can automate the process with a Python script that interacts with Outlook through the win32com.client library. This script reads email addresses from a text file and sends a message to each email address.

Here's a sample script that does the following:

Reads email addresses from a text file (Notepad).
Uses win32com.client to connect to Outlook.
Composes a marketing email and sends it to each email address.
Prerequisites:

Python must be installed.
win32com.client library must be installed. If you don't have it, you can install it with pip install pywin32.
Outlook must be installed on your Windows system and configured with an account.

Instructions to Run the Script
Prepare the Email List:
Create a text file (e.g., emails.txt) with each email address on a new line.
Save the text file in a known location, like your Desktop or Documents folder.
Configure the Script:
Change the file_path variable to point to the location of your text file.
Modify the subject and body variables to customize your marketing email content.
Run the Script:
Save the script as a Python file (e.g., send_emails.py).
Open a Command Prompt or Terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run python send_emails.py.
This script automates sending marketing emails to multiple recipients using Outlook. Before running it, ensure you comply with email marketing regulations like CAN-SPAM (US), CASL (Canada), and GDPR (EU). If you have additional questions or need further guidance, I can help.
